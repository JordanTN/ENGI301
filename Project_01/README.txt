# Project_01
Glove Com
By Jordan Ngo

As a part of ENGI301 and BIOE451, I aimed to create a glove that is capable of sending preset messages by flexing specific fingers. 
Due to material shortage, I change the project to resemble a keyboard, with 5 buttons to similate flexing 5 fingers. 
The device is operated with the left hand, and the thumb key activates the device. 
There are 10 preset button combinations that mimick finger flexes.
